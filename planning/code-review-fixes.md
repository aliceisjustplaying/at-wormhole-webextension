# Code Review Fixes Implementation Plan

**Created**: 2024-06-15
**Last Updated**: 2025-06-15
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Critical Issues
**Overall Progress**: 25% of Phase 1 Complete (1/4 tasks), 11% of Phase 3 Complete (1/3 tasks)

## Overview

This plan addresses all issues identified in the comprehensive code review of the AT Protocol Wormhole extension. Fixes are organized by priority and will be implemented in phases to ensure stability and proper testing.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Critical Issues (High Priority)

- [x] P1.1: Fix Service Worker Race Condition ✅
- [ ] P1.2: Add Error UI in Popup
- [ ] P1.3: Implement Request Debouncing
- [ ] P1.4: Add URL Validation

### Phase 2: Memory and Performance Issues (Medium Priority)

- [ ] P2.1: Fix Options Module Memory Leak
- [ ] P2.2: Improve Cache Size Estimation
- [ ] P2.3: Centralize API Configuration

### Phase 3: Code Quality Improvements (Medium Priority)

- [x] P3.1: Consolidate Options Code ✅
- [ ] P3.2: Improve Type Guards
- [ ] P3.3: Replace Console Usage

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation (Low Priority)

- [ ] P4.1: Expand Test Coverage
- [ ] P4.2: Add JSDoc Documentation

### Phase 5: Additional Improvements (Low Priority)

- [ ] P5.1: Implement Request Cancellation
- [ ] P5.2: Add Rate Limiting

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Each task will have its own markdown file in the planning folder
2. All code changes must pass validation commands without disabling rules
3. Unit tests will be added for each fix where applicable
4. User-friendly error messages will be used in UI
5. Rate limiting will be configurable

## Success Criteria

- All ESLint and TypeScript errors resolved properly
- All validation commands pass after each change
- No use of eslint-disable or @ts-ignore
- Each fix is minimal and focused
- Tests pass for all changes

## Risk Mitigation

- Each fix will be tested in isolation
- Breaking changes will be avoided
- Existing functionality will be preserved
- Changes will be backwards compatible

## Task Breakdown Process

For each task in the phases above, I will:

1. Create a dedicated markdown file (e.g., `P1.1-service-worker-race-condition.md`)
2. Detail the specific issue and solution approach
3. List affected files
4. Define test criteria
5. Track implementation progress

## Notes

- No data migration needed per user confirmation
- Unit tests preferred over integration tests initially
- Error messages should be user-friendly, not technical
- Rate limiting should be configurable
